I am an enthusiastic master student in computer science specializing in data science and machine learning at the Radboud university in Nijmegen. I obtained my bachelors degree in computer science from the [Rijksuniversiteit in Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) in 2018. In addition to my course work, I have worked part-time as a Teacher Assistant for CS courses and as a software engineer at [Tedas](https://www.tedas.nl). After I obtained my bachelor degree, I spend a year as a student researcher at [Porsche](https://www.porsche.com/netherlands/nl/) in Weissach, Germany. 

During and after my master in computer science, I aspire to continue my research in robust/interpretable machine learning and explore other areas as well. To do this, I am always looking for new and interesting opportunities in the form of research internships or collaborations. After finalizing my masters degree I hope to join a PhD. program.
