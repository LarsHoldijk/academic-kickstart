abstract: "Time-series classification is an interesting and challenging sub-domain of classification problems. In distance based classification algorithms, the information hidden in the ordering of the time-series and the possibility of misalignment require the use of specialized dissimilarity measures. In this thesis we look at three such measures, all of which are based on Hankel matrices and the assumption that Hankel matrices with the same subspace originate from the same LTI-series and consequently from the same class. In previous work all three dissimilarity measures have shown competitive results when combined with k-Nearest Neighbours. In our work we combine two of the three dissimilarity measure with Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ) using a rewriting of derivatives presented in earlier work. The results presented show promise for the dissimilarity measures to be applied in GLVQ."
