From the 11th till the 13th of September the 11th Mittweida Workshop for Computational Intelligence (MiWoCI) took place in MittWeida, Germany. During this three day event researcher from industry and academia come together to discuss theory and applications of machine learning.

During the first day I gave a short talk titled "Classication-by-Components: Current and Future Work" in which I discussed the recent work I did at Porsche AG.

ABSTRACT: 
In the newly introduced Classication-by-Components (CBC) method input samples
are classied by decomposing them into components and consecutively matching the ex-
tracted decomposition plan against the decomposition plans of possible classes. The com-
ponents used in CBC models function as an extension of the prototype concept in clas-
siers, such as Learning Vector Quantization. Opposed to prototypes, components are
not required to be class specic and can have a smaller size than the input samples. The
matching of the decomposition plan is realized in CBCs by learning which components
are important to be detected and which components are important to not be detected
for an object to belong to a specic class. Additionally, there is also the possibility for
components to be not important to the classication process at all. In this contribution
we will provide a high-level overview of how the components and the class specic decom-
position plans are modelled and learned in CBCs, shortly discuss the results presented in
the introductory paper on CBCs and discuss the current projects and future work.
