From the 8th till the 14th of December 2019, I visited the thirty-third conference of neural information processing systems, also known as NeurIPS, in Vancouver, Canada. While I already had the chance to visit the conference last year in Montreal, and present my work on prototype-based neural network layers during one of the workshops, this was the first time I discussed my work at the main conference. With over 10.000 attendees, this was an incredible experience. Over the course of an intense, but amazing, two-hour poster session, me and my collaborators discussed our work on Classification-by-Components networks. I can?t thank everyone that dropped by and had such nice and engaging questions enough. 

The remaining days of the conference I had a great time catching up with old friends and colleagues from Germany. Vancouver is an amazing city. Hearing that the conference will be held in Canada in 2020 as well will be a great motivator for the next deadline.
