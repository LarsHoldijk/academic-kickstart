In July of 2018 I finalized my bachelor studies in computer science by handing in my bachelor thesis "Time-series classification using Hankel matrix based dissimilarity measures in Learning Vector Quantization". I worked on my thesis under the supervision of prof. [Michael Biehl](https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.biehl/) and [Mohammad Mohammadi](https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.mohammadi/research). The thesis was awarded a grade of 9 out of 10.
